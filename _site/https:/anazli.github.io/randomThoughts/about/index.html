<p>Greetings, my name is Andreas Nazlidis. I’m a postgraduate Computational Physicist of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and I’m currenty living in the city of Munich in south Germany where I work to make a living and at the same time I’m learning Deutsch.</p>

<p>This is my personal site and blog where I post some of the mini-projects I’ve written over the last years during my post-graduate studies and also what I write at present.</p>

<p>During my studies I learned (mostly by myself) how to program in C++, Python, Fortran77 and LaTeX. I have also used software like <em>Mathematica</em>, <em>MatLab</em>, <em>GNU octave</em> and <em>Semcad X</em>. I’ve recently taken some online courses in Machine and Deep learning where I wrote some code in Python and lerned a little bit about <em>Tensorflow</em> and <em>Keras</em>. Currently I’m also trying to learn about Computer Graphics with <em>OpenGL</em> by following some good online tutorials. What I’ve also found very interesting is the ray tracing algorithm used in CG when I was reading the book <em>Ray tracing in one weekend</em> by Peter Shirley.</p>

<p>Other interests include a lot of Music like Jazz/Blues, Rock, pop, instrumental, clasical, dub-Techno, ambient and others. I like reading mystery novels, detective stories, historical or fantasy novels. There are too many good films that I like to list them here. Favorite games are <em>the legend of zelda</em>, <em>broken sword</em>, <em>siberia</em>, <em>god of war</em>, <em>diablo</em> and also many good old arcade ones.</p>
