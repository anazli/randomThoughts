# About

Greetings, my name is Andreas Nazlidis. I'm a postgraduate Computational Physicist of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and I'm currently living in the city of Munich in southern Germany where I work to make a living and at the same time I'm learning Deutsch.

This is my personal site and blog where I publish content about my personal interests and projects I've written over the last years during my post-graduate studies and also what I write at present. 

During my studies I learned (mostly by myself) how to program in *C++*, *Python*, *Fortran77* and *LaTeX*. Moreover, I've also used software like *Mathematica*, *MatLab*, *GNU octave* and *Semcad X*. These tools helped me to learn and implement computational techniques which are applied in physics, such as *Monte Carlo* methods, *Molecular Dynamics*, methods used in *Numerical Analysis* and the *FDTD* method in Computational Electrodynamics.

Apart from my studies, I've recently taken some online courses in Machine and Deep learning using the *Python* programming language and libraries like *Tensorflow* and *Keras*. Currently I'm also trying to learn about Computer Graphics with *OpenGL* by following some good online tutorials. What I've also found very interesting is the *ray tracing* algorithm by reading Peter Shirley's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8" target="_blank">_Ray tracing in one weekend_</a> mini-book.

Other personal interests are: music including jazz/blues, rock, pop, instrumental, clasical, dub-Techno, ambient and others. I like reading mystery novels, detective stories, historical or fantasy novels. Too many good films too list them here. Favorite games are *The legend of zelda*, *Broken sword*, *Gabriel knight* *Syberia*, *God of war*, *Diablo* and also some good old arcades.
