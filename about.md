# About

Greetings, my name is Andreas Nazlidis. I'm a postgraduate Computational Physicist of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and I'm currenty living in the city of Munich in south Germany where I work to make a living and at the same time I'm learning Deutsch.

This is my personal site and blog where I post some of the mini-projects I've written over the last years during my post-graduate studies and also what I write at present. 

During my studies I learned (mostly by myself) how to program in C++, Python, Fortran77 and LaTeX. I have also used software like *Mathematica*, *MatLab*, *GNU octave* and *Semcad X*. I've recently taken some online courses in Machine and Deep learning where I wrote some code in Python and lerned a little bit about *Tensorflow* and *Keras*. Currently I'm also trying to learn about Computer Graphics with *OpenGL* by following some good online tutorials. What I've also found very interesting is the ray tracing algorithm used in CG when I was reading the book _Ray tracing in one weekend_ by Peter Shirley.

Other interests include a lot of Music like Jazz/Blues, Rock, pop, instrumental, clasical, dub-Techno, ambient and others. I like reading mystery novels, detective stories, historical or fantasy novels. There are too many good films that I like to list them here. Favorite games are *the legend of zelda*, *broken sword*, *siberia*, *god of war*, *diablo* and also many good old arcade ones.
